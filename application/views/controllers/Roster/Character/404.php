<h1><?php echo $character->name; ?></h1>

<p>Oh dear. Sorry, but this character profile could not be displayed, possibly for one of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The character has been inactive for an extended period of time.</li>
    <li>The profile is temporarily unavailable while the character is in the midst of a process such as a race change or character customisation.</li>
    <li>The character has been recently deleted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing more to see here, perhaps you want to <a href="javascript:window.history.back();">go back?</a></p>
