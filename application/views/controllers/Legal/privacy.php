	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

	<p>uGuilds World of Warcraft Guild Hosting (hereafter "uGuilds"), a non-profit individual operation operating within and adhering to the Data Protection principles of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (hereafter the "United Kingdom"), respect the privacy rights of their on-line visitors and recognise the importance of providing a secure environment for the information they collect.</p>

	<p>It is therefore important to make available to on-line visitors an explanatory document outlining how their personal details are collected, processed and utilized (hereafter the "Privacy Policy"). This Privacy Policy explains the ways in which uGuilds safeguards the privacy rights of its on-line visitors. By using this website, you accept this Privacy Policy. Please note that the uGuilds Privacy Policy does not apply when you access other sites via the web links located on Blizzard internet sites, as we have no control over the activities of these other sites. Furthermore, this Privacy Policy may vary from time to time; please consult this document periodically so that you are aware of any changes. The date of the last update, shown at the bottom of this page, indicates the date of the most recent modifications.</p>

	<p>This Privacy Policy respects applicable data protection laws and its principles are based on the United Kingdom's Data Protection Act 1998.</p>

	<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the uGuilds.com domain and all its subdomains.</p>

	<h2>What personal information we collect and how we use it?</h2>

	<p>only collects personal information in accordance with the applicable laws. An on-line visitor generally submits data to uGuilds for the following purposes: (1) to access personalized services for guild members; (2) to apply for membership within our guild; (3) to enquire and obtain information regarding our services; and/or (4) use of the forums.</p>

	<p>For the purposes outlined above, uGuilds may require that you submit certain personal information, which may include your name, your country of residence, your email address, your age and/or your date of birth. We do not require this information if you are just visiting our sites, but you may be unable to access certain areas of the sites or use certain features, such as the forums, without registering, or receive certain materials such as our information bulletins without providing a certain amount of personal information.</p>

	<p>All donations are handled through PayPal Europe S.a.r.l. &amp; Cie, S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449, Luxembourg, and is subject to their applicable <a href="https://cms.paypal.com/uk/cgi-bin/marketingweb?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=ua/Privacy_full&locale.x=en_GB" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. uGuilds does not capture or retain financial information, including credit card information.</p>

	<h2>What other information we will collect and how we will use it?</h2>

	<p>Your web browser or your client software will forward to uGuilds geographical information, data concerning your computer (e.g. capabilities and browser type,) and data concerning the way you use the products and services. uGuilds will use this data to generate aggregate statistics about its user community. In addition, uGuilds will use such information for security, system integrity (the prevention of hacking, etc.), or enforcement purposes. We will sometimes link this information with your personal information if we feel that the conditions of use have been violated or at the request of the legal authorities.</p>

	<p>If you are a registered user, your information may be stored in uGuildsâ€™s databases to customize the website for you, to provide customized information about uGuilds and its services for you, as well as for other publicity purposes.</p>

	<h2>What cookies are and how we use them?</h2>

	<p>Cookies are small data files sent to your hard disk from the Internet sites you visit. Any cookies stored on your computer can be used to recall details such as your password or a previous registration or authentication.</p>

	<p>uGuilds may use cookies on its Internet sites to keep track of the fact that you signed in, so that you do not have to continually enter your password or your registration details.</p>

	<p>uGuilds may use cookies to collect information about the sections of the websites you visit, the products you are interested in, and to track your navigation through its websites.</p>

	<p>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. You can block cookies or set your browser to receive a warning message before any cookies are saved onto your PC. If you would prefer not to have any cookies installed on your hard drive, we recommend that you consult your browser documentation or the help window for more information. Cookies may, however, be necessary for running certain applications on our sites and blocking them may result in your being unable to access certain applications.</p>

	<h2>What IP (Internet Protocol) addresses are and how we use them?</h2>

	<p>An IP address is the number assigned to your server or your computer by your Internet Service Pro-vider ("ISP"). uGuilds may require these IP addresses for account authentication, or for system administration purposes. We may sometimes use these IP addresses and associate them with a particular account or user if we feel that the conditions of use have been violated or at the request of the legal authorities.</p>

	<h2>Who collects, processes and uses your information?</h2>

	<p>When you visit an uGuilds site and you are asked to provide information, you only share this information with uGuilds except where clearly indicated to the contrary. Some services are, however, provided in conjunction with Blizzard Entertainment SAS in France and Blizzard Entertainment Ireland Limited, and for the provision of these services, uGuilds may share your personal information with these companies. If a company other than Blizzard receives your personal data, you will be notified before this operation takes place. In any case, the transfer of personal data to another company will only be carried out with your express authorization.</p>

	<p>The information you enter on forms on uGuilds's websites will only be sent to Blizzard once you have clicked the "Send" or the "OK" button. You can halt the transfer of data at any time by quitting the form screen, i.e. by closing your web browser prior to clicking the "Send" or the "OK" buttons; no information will then be sent to uGuilds.</p>

	<p>Please bear in mind that message boards and Internet sites linked to our sites could obtain some of your personal information. We would remind you that uGuilds's Privacy Policy does not apply to these message boards or to these other sites, as we have no control over their activities.</p>

	<h2>With whom we may share your information?</h2>

	<p>As a general rule, uGuilds will not forward your information to a third party without your permission. In some cases, we can disclose this information if our License Agreements or Terms of Service have been violated or if, in all good faith, we judge it is legally justified.</p>

	<p>Your personal information is also an asset of uGuilds. uGuilds is an individually-owned UK operation. As such, in the event of the disolution of the services, or death of the operating individual, your personal data will be securely destroyed.</p>

	<h2>What your rights are concerning the collection, use and distribution of your personal data?</h2>

	<p>uGuilds allows you to monitor the way in which we use the personal information we obtain. Any promotional materials which uGuilds may send to you (e.g. "newsletters" or "information bulletins") contain internal mechanisms that allow you to block future mailings (Opt-out).</p>

	<p>You can also contact us if you wish to change the way in which we use your personal information, i.e. whether uGuilds can send you e-mails regarding our products or services.</p>

	<p>You can contact us at the following address: uGuilds World of Warcraft Guild Hosting, C/O Ben Argo, 6 Berkeley Road, Cirencester, GL7 1TY, United Kingdom. Please state which services or publications you no longer wish to receive so that we can respond to your needs more effectively.</p>

	<h2>What level of security is applied to your personal information?</h2>

	<p>uGuilds deems it a point of honour that the information you send us should be protected and should remain in its original form, i.e. unaltered. In this respect, access to all private data is strictly monitored.</p>

	<h2>What you should do if you wish to amend or review your personal information?</h2>

	<p>If, for any reason, you are concerned about the way in which we collect your personal information, if you wish to access, amend or correct it, or if you want us to delete it from our servers, please contact uGuilds World of Warcraft Guild Hosting, C/O Ben Argo, 6 Berkeley Road, Cirencester, GL7 1TY, United Kingdom. Please note that the deletion of your data will lead to the termination of your account and applicable services.</p>

	<p>If you have any questions or complaints, please write a letter to: uGuilds World of Warcraft Guild Hosting, C/O Ben Argo, 6 Berkeley Road, Cirencester, GL7 1TY, United Kingdom.</p>

	<h2>Note to parents</h2>

	<p>No information should be transmitted to uGuilds by minors aged 13 years or under. uGuilds commits to never knowingly processing data provided by minors aged 13 years or under. We feel under a particular obligation to protect information obtained from young children. We would strongly urge parents to instruct their children never to disclose their information to us.</p>

	<p>Adolescents aged 13-17 years should ask their parents to read our Privacy Policy and to contact us if they would like any information on our guarantee of confidentiality or to comment on the content.</p>
