<p>Thanks for doing that, <?php echo $character_name; ?>. 
	I know it's a bit of a hastle but we need to be certain that you really are who you say you are.</p>
		
<p>We're pretty much done here, but there's just one final hurdle we need to clear. 
	We've sent an email to <em><?php echo $email; ?></em> 
	with a link you'll need to copy and paste into your browser in order to fully activate your account. 
	You might want to double-check your junk folder if it's not there, 
	and add <em>noreply@uguilds.net</span> to your contacts or your trusted senders list for future reference.</p>
